Cheerily is an app for cheering you up. It lets you browse super cute pictures downloaded from Reddit's Aww subreddit, and save them for offline viewing.

Usage is simple. 

When you first open it, it will ask you to login with your Reddit account, which it needs in order to download the pictures.

The app operates via the following buttons.

MOAR PLZ - to load the next picture.
SAVE - save picture for offline/later viewing.
My SAVES - view saved pictures.

Have fun!
